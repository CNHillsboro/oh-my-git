When you have a symbolic ref (a ref pointing at another ref), and you decide you want it to be a regular ref again (pointing to an object), you're in for some trouble! :)

What happens when you try pointing the symbolic ref directly to the blob using `git update-ref`?

Oops! Turns out that when you reference a symbolic ref, it acts as if you had specified the ref it points to. To de-symbolic-ize it, use the `--no-deref` option directly after `update-ref`!

Weird, huh?
