The events and timelines you see are always only what your own time machine knows about!

Of course, time agents don't have to work alone! Here, your sidekick has already prepared a merge for you! You can use the "pull" card to transfer it to your own machine.

Then, add another event on top, and "push" the result, to transfer it back to your sidekick!
