cards = checkout commit-auto reset-hard branch

[description]

You were invited to two parties but they will happen at the same time! At party 1 your favorite band is playing and the other one is your best friend's birthday party.

Where should you go? No worries - you are a time travel agent in training. You can go to both parties! To quickly switch between both events, check out the last commits and
create branches with the `git branch [string]` command. Now you can easily switch between both branches by calling `git checkout [branch]`.

[setup]

echo "-Birthday present.
-Concert ticket." > backpack
git add .
git commit -m "evening preparations"
echo "-Birthday present." > backpack
git add .
git commit -m "go to the birthday"

git checkout HEAD~1
echo "-Concert ticket." > backpack
git add .
git commit -m "go to the concert"

git checkout HEAD~1

[win]

NUM_BRANCHES="$(git show-ref --heads | wc -l)"
test "$NUM_BRANCHES" -ge 3

[congrats]

Your friend is happy that you made it to the birthday party and you also got your concert ticket signed. Yay!
