[description]

Life is full of dangers, right? Even when walking to school, it seems like there's a lot of risks!

This Monday is especially bad. You made it to school, but there's some timelines you definitely don't want to keep around.

Find the bad branches and delete them. Keep the one that seems okay.

[setup]

echo You leave your house and start walking to school. > you
git add .
git commit -m "Good morning!"

echo You walk on the right side of the street. >> you
git commit -am "Right side"

echo You jump over an manhole in the walkway, and arrive at school on time. >> you
git commit -am "Jump"

git checkout HEAD^ -b friend
echo Suddenly, you fall down, splash into stinking water, and are eaten by an alligator. >> you
git commit -am "A new friend"

git checkout HEAD~2 -b music
echo You walk on the left side of the street. >> you
git commit -am "Left side"

echo Because you\'re kind of late, you start running. Someone throws a piano out of their windows, and it smashes you. >> you
git commit -am "Sounds nice"

git checkout HEAD^ -b ice-cream
echo You\'re not in a hurry, and walk slowly. You even get some ice cream on your way. You arrive at school too late, and your teacher is angry. >> you
git commit -am "Yum"

git checkout main

[win]

test "$(git branch | cut -c 3-)" = "$(echo -e ice-cream\\nmain)"

[congrats]

On second thought, maybe you even prefer the ice cream timeline to the main one? :)
