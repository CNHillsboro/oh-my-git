Didn't get enouth sleep last night? Here's a trick so that you can sleep a bit longer: just do all your morning activities in parallel universes, and then at the end, merge them together!

There are already timelines where you get a baguette and coffee. Can you make a third one where you get a donut? Drag the "branch" card to a commit to make a new branch there.

And then, use the "merge" card to join the specified timeline together with your current one. If you merge everything into "main" in the end, into a reality where you have a baguette, a coffee, and a dount, and are outside of all shops, you can still make it to work on time!

[setup]

echo "A friendly old lady.
Sells delicious baguettes for 5 coins each." > bakery/mary

echo "A rebellious teenager.
Sells good coffee for 2 coins each." > coffee_shop/larry

echo "A snail. Literally a snail.
Sells donuts with an unspecified, slimy filling - for 3 coins each." > donut_shop/gary

echo "You do not have a baguette.

You do not have coffee.

You do not have a donut." > you

git add .
git commit -m "The Beginning"

git checkout -b baguette

You do not have a donut." > you
git mv you bakery
