*ring ring* Oh no! You wanted to meet with your parents in your student apartment and your alarm did not go off in time to clean your room!
"Coming!" you yell while you jump out of bed. Now quick! Remove all litter and trash you can find by using `rm [file]` and commit your changes.

[setup]

echo Very smelly socks. > socks
echo A tiny couch table. > table
echo An empty energy drink can. > can
echo An empty bag of chips. > bag
git add .
git commit -m "weekend"

[win]

NUM_FILES="$(git ls-tree --name-only -r HEAD | wc -l)"
test "$NUM_FILES" -eq 1 && test "$(git ls-tree --name-only -r HEAD)" = "table"

[congrats]

Your parents are happy to see you (and of course your neat and tidy apartment)!
