So a tree describes the state of a directory structure at a specific point in time.

It would be nice if we could remember when that state existed, and who authored it, right?

Enter: commits. They are objects that point to a tree and contain some additional metadata. You can create a commit using

    $ git commit-tree <tree> -m "Description of your commit"

Make a commit from the tree in this repository!
