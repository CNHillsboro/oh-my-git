title = A better way

[description]

One month later, you're woking on an essay about tardigrades!

This time, a friend has recommended that you use the version control system Git to keep backups of your file.

Currently, your directory only contains your essay. To initialize a Git repository in your directory, type:

    git init

Then, each time you want to make a backup, type:

    git add essay.txt
    git commit

Enter a description of what you changed in the editor that opens and click save.

That way, you've made a backup of the current version of the file. Then add at least two more lines, and make another backup by repeating the add and the commit commands.

[setup]

rm -rf .git

echo "~ Why tardigrades are cool ~

- They can survive in space.
- They are resistant to extreme heat and cold." > essay.txt

[win]

test -d .git && git rev-parse HEAD^ && test "$(git show HEAD:essay.txt | wc -l)" -ge 6
