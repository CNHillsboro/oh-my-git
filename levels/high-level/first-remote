A friend has asked you to help with an essay about hobbies! She has already started to write a list, started tracking it in a Git repository. You can get a copy by typing

    git pull friend main

Help her by adding at least two more items to the list! When you're done, commit your result and use

    git push friend main

to send it to her copy of the repository!

[congrats]

"Thanks, these are some really nice hobbies! Hope we can do that together soon!"
