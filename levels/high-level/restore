title = Looking into the past

[description]

You've been working on your essay for a while. But - ughh! Now your cat walks over your keyboard and "helps you", so now it's all messed up again! :/

To restore your essay from the last backup, type:

    git checkout essay.txt

To restore an older version, for example, from two backups before the latest one, type:

    git checkout HEAD~2 essay.txt

For nostalgic reasons, restore the very first backup you made!

[setup]

echo "A" >> essay.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

echo "B" >> essay.txt
git commit -a -m "Improved version"

echo "C" >> essay.txt
git commit -a -m "Even better version"

echo "D" >> essay.txt
git commit -a -m "Marvelous version"

echo "blarg
blaaaargh" > essay.txt

[win]

diff essay.txt <(echo "A")
