Blobs usually represent the content of a file. But on their own, they don't have any metadata, not even a name!

Git has a very powerful concept to store metadata related to blobs: the index! It's a list that relates blobs to filenames and permissions.

Even though it is possible to add an entry directly to the index, it's much more convenient to do it via an existing file:

    $ echo "my content" > file
    $ git update-index --add file

Add three entries to the index! For a bonus challenge: can you add a file that is inside of a directory, like "directory/file"?
