[description]

If you want to keep your changes but they don't belong to the main branch, you can easily
create a new branch from your stashed changes. Just use
    git stash branch <branchname> <stash>
If you just want to use the latest stash entry, you can leave the <stash> option empty.

Create a new branch from the stashed changes!
    
Clear you stash stack!
