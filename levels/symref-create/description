Instead of pointing directly to objects, refs can also point to other refs!

When that happens, they are called "symbolic refs". You can create or update a symbolic ref using

    git symbolic-ref <name> <ref>

Usually, you will only encounter a special symbolic ref called "HEAD". This ref is special in that it doesn't start with "refs/"! You might already have seen it in the other levels - it's the only thing that's always there!

Try pointing HEAD to the refs in this repository!
