Blobs just have some content and an ID. It would be convenient to be able to give names to a blob, right?

The second type of Git object is called a "tree" - a tree points a bunch of blobs, and gives each of them a name!

How can we build our own trees? Introducing: the index!

The index is like a "work in progress" version of a tree, where we can add and remove blobs. When we're happy with what we have built, we can make it into a real tree object!

We can use

    $ git update-index --add <file>

to make the file's content into a blob, and to add that blob to the index using the file's name.

When we're happy with out index, we can convert it into a tree using

    $ git write-tree

That command will output the ID of the newly crated tree.

Build a tree containing just the 'noises' file, which we conveniently placed in your current directory! :)
