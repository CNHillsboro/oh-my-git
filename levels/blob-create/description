At its core, Git is very simple. It stores "objects", which are basically files identified by an "identifier" (short: ID).

There are four types of objects: blobs, trees, commits, and tags. The simplest type is a "blob", which is just a piece of text.

Let's create some blobs! To do that, create a file with the desired content, and then use

    $ git hash-object -w <file>

The flag -w means "write", and tells Git to actually write the new blob to the disk.

Create three new blobs!

Tip: you can also use a command like this to create a blob in a single line:

    $ echo "awesome content" | git hash-object -w --stdin
