Let's take a look at "refs", short for "references"! Refs are not objects, but rather very simple *pointers* to objects! They can help you keep track of what's where.

You can create or update a ref with

    git update-ref refs/<refname> <newvalue>

Make sure to start a ref's name with "refs/"! That's a convention that helps Git find all refs you create.

Create refs that point to all objects in this repository!
