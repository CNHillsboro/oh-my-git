So you've been working on a project for a while, and decide you want to put it in a Git repository.

Here's how to do it! First, you initialize a new Git repository in your current directory:

    git init

Then say that you want to record the current state of all files:

    git add .

And then you make a commit, which gives the current state a description, a date, and your name:

    git commit

[setup]

mkdir recipes
echo -e "blueberries\nflour" > recipes/blueberry_cake.txt
echo -e "water\ncarrots" > recipes/carrot soup.txt
echo "Very good recipes!" > README.md

[win]

test "$(git rev-parse HEAD^{tree})" = 1e02e3151284d0e22cd9b07ca5c5dbae2f3cb521
