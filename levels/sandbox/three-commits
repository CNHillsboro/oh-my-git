That's all for now! Here's a sandbox you can play around in.

Did you see the black terminal at the very bottom? All cards you play translate into actual commands, and there'a a real Git repo behind this! Fun things to try:

- Make a commit that merges three timelines together at once!
- Create some tags!
- Make a timeline that's completely independent of the rest!
