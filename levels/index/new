[description]

In the index, we can prepare what will be in the next commit.

Initially, the index will be empty, and all files are untracked. If you have a file, and you want to have it in the next commit, use `git add`!

[setup]

echo a > a
echo b > b
echo c > c

[win]

# Add all three files to the index.
test "$(git diff --cached --name-only | wc -l)" -eq 3
