title = Add new files to the index
cards = add commit

[description]

But Git allows to you capture changes with more precision!

To understand how to do that, you need to learn about [your teacher raises her voice dramatically] *the index*!

In the index, we can prepare what will be in the next commit. In this game, the index is represented by a blue aura!

Initially, all files are untracked. If you have a file, and you want to have it in the next commit, use `git add`!

Here, we don't use the fancy commit card, but a plain `git commit`!

[setup]

echo a > a
echo b > b
echo c > c

[win]

# Add all three files to the index.
test "$(git ls-files | wc -l)" -eq 3

# And make a commit.
test "$(git ls-tree main | wc -l)" -eq 3
