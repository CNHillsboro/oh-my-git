[description]

So far, you have made commits using a pretty convenient command, which captures the complete working directory as it is in a commit. See how the card says something about "add"?

Let's try using that one again! (Only pay attention to the white, actual files for now!)

[setup]

echo a > a
echo b > b
echo c > c
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

git commit -m "Nothing changed" --allow-empty

[win]

# Make a single commit where you modify a file ...
git show --name-status --oneline | grep '^M	'

# ... add a new file ...
git show --name-status --oneline | grep '^A	'

# ... and delete a file.
git show --name-status --oneline | grep '^D	'
