Welcome to today's lesson! Today, we're going to learn how to make commits with precision!

Have a look at these two timelines. They have exactly the same outcome. But one of them makes it much easier to figure out what happened.

[setup]

echo "A small, but heavy glass ball." > ball
echo "A thin book, that's standing upright." > book
echo "A candle, burning with a blue flame." > candle

git add .
git commit -m "The beginning"

git branch -M all-at-once

echo "The ball is now touching the book." > ball
echo "The book has fallen over." > book
echo "The candle has been blown out." > candle

git commit -am "The end"

git checkout HEAD^

git checkout -b step-by-step

echo "The ball is now touching the book." > ball
git commit -am "The ball rolls towards the book"

echo "The book has fallen over." > book
git commit -am "The book falls over"

echo "The candle has been blown out." > candle
git commit -am "The book blows out the candle"

git checkout HEAD~3
