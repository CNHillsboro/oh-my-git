[setup]

# Bash commands that set up the initial state of the level. An initial
# `git init` is always done automatically. The default branch is called `main`.

echo You > people_who_are_awesome
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

[win]

# Bash commands that check whether the level is solved. Write these as if you're
# writing the body of a Bash function. Make the function return 0 if it's
# solved, and a non-zero value otherwise. You can use `return`, and also, Bash
# functions return the exit code of the last statement, which sometimes allows
# very succinct checks.

# Check whether the file has at least two lines in the latest commit:
test "$(git show HEAD:people_who_are_awesome | wc -l)" -ge 2
