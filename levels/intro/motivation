[description]

So you've been working on an essay about goldfish. You can look at the backup copies you made by clicking on them!

But look - something went wrong in the latest version of the file! Maybe it has been infected with a vowel-eating virus?

[congrats]

Good that you had that backup, huh?

But you're a bit worried that two weeks from now, you'll have hundreds of copies of your essay, and it will be hard to keep track of all of them.

And especially when working with other people, sending backup copies around doesn't seem ideal.

Let's look at another way to do this. :) Click "Next Level" as soon as you're ready!

[setup]

rm -rf .git

echo "~ Why goldfish are the best pets ~

(I still need to write this.)" >> essay1.txt


echo "~ Why goldfish are the best pets ~

- They don't make any noise.
- They are pretty. (I should probably put this higher in the list?)" >> essay2.txt


echo "~ Why goldfish are the best pets ~

- They are pretty.
- They don't pee on the carpet.
- They don't make any noise." >> essay3.txt

echo "~ Why gldfsh r th bst pts ~

- Thy r prtty.
- Thy dn't p n th crpt.
- Thy dn't mk ny ns." >> essay4.txt

[win]

# Make a new version (with the number 5) from the last version that's still okay
cat essay5.txt | grep carpet

# And add at least two more lines to it!
test "$(cat essay5.txt | wc -l )" -ge 7
