A friend has asked you to help with an essay about hobbies! She has already started to write a list, started tracking it in a Git repository. You can get a copy by using `git pull`!


[congrats]

"Thanks, these are some really nice hobbies! Hope we can do that together soon!"

[setup]

echo "~ Best hobbies ~" > hobbies.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial version"

git push -u friend main

[setup friend]

git checkout main
echo " 
- Collecting stamps
- Looking at clouds" >> hobbies.txt

git add .
git commit -m "Added two hobbies"

[win]

# Help her by adding at least two more items to the list! 
test "$(cat hobbies.txt |wc -l)" -ge 6

[win friend]

# When you're done, commit your result and use `git push` to send it to her copy of the repository!
test "$(git show main:hobbies.txt |wc -l)" -ge 6
