title = A pull and a conflict

[description]

You want to push your new commits to the server, but someone has already pushed their own changes.

In this situation, you need to pull first! Try that here - you'll have to resolve a merge conflict. Push your changes afterwards.

Good job! Here's some additional info: banana!

[setup yours]

echo fu > file
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push

echo fi > file
git commit -a -m "Fi is good"

[setup origin]

echo fa > file
git add .
git commit -a -m "Fa is good"

[win origin]

test "$(git rev-parse HEAD^1^)" = "$(git rev-parse HEAD^2^)"
