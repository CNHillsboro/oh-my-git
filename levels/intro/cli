[description]

These playing cards are designed to be easy to use and to remember! We'd suggest sticking to them if you don't have a lot of experience with Git!

[cli]

But there's another way to interact with Git:

Try typing `git init` into the black terminal below, and pressing the enter key!

[setup]

rm -rf .git

[win]

# Initialize the time machine!
test -d .git

[congrats]

Cool! When you don't use the cards in a level, you'll get a golden sparkling "command line badge"! See it in the top left?

The command line is pretty powerful! Often, you can use it to solve tasks faster compared to using a graphical interface.

It's also totally optional in this game. But if you want to learn how to use Git from the command line, we invite you to this challenge! :)
