One month later, you're working on an essay about cats.

You've started making backup copies of your essay regularly - you can look at them by clicking on them!

You think that you're almost done - your current version, just needs one more line!

[congrats]

Okay, this kind of works.

But you're a bit worried that two weeks from now, you'll have hundreds of copies of your essay, and it will be hard to keep track of all of them.

And especially when working with other people, sending copies back and forth doesn't seem ideal.

You wonder what would be a better way to do this.
