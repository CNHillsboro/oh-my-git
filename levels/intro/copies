One month later, you're working on an essay about cats.
You've started making backup copies of your essay regularly - you can look at them by clicking on them!

Your current version, essay4.txt, needs one more line

[congrats]

Okay, this works. But you're a bit worried that two weeks from now, you'll have hundreds of copies of your essay, and it will be hard to keep track of all of them.

And especially when working with other people, sending copies back and forth doesn't seem ideal. Let's look at another way to do this!

[setup]

rm -rf .git

echo "~ Why cats are the best pets ~

(I still need to write this.)" >> essay1.txt


echo "~ Why cats are the best pets ~

- They live longer than goldfish." >> essay2.txt


echo "~ Why cats are the best pets ~

- They live longer than goldfish.
- Their little paws are super cute." >> essay3.txt

cp essay3.txt essay4.txt
