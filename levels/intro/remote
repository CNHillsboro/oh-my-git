[description]

Let's add your name to our list of students! I already have this list my time machine - let's work together!

Drag the "clone" card to my name to make your own copy of my timeline!

[cli]

To clone the teacher's repo via the command line, you need this command:

    git clone ../teacher .

(Don't forget the dot at the end!)

[congrats]

Welcome to time travel school! :) I'll see you for your first class tomorrow!

[setup]

rm -rf .git

[setup teacher]

echo "~ List of current students ~" > students
git add .
git commit -m "Initial version"

echo " 
- Sam
- Alex" >> students

git add .
git commit -m "Added two students"

[win]

# Get a copy of your teacher's timeline using `git clone`!
test -d .git

# Add your name to the list of students
test "$(cat students |wc -l)" -ge 5

# Commit your result.
test "$(git show main:students |wc -l)" -ge 5

[win teacher]

# And use `git push` to send it to your teacher!
test "$(git show main:students |wc -l)" -ge 5
