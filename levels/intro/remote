A friend has asked you to help with an essay about hobbies! She has already started to write a list, and started tracking it with her own time machine!

[congrats]

"Thanks, these are some really nice hobbies! Hope we can do that together soon!"

You're still pretty confused by everything that's going on. The next day, you decide to enroll in time travel school!
