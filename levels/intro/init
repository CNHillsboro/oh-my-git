title = Enter the time machine
cards = init

[description]

You've been accepted to time travel school! Yay! It's your first day! Your teacher explains:

"To do anything with a time machine, you first need to initialize it!"

Drag the blue card up to play it!

[cli]

Instead of using the card, you can also type `git init` into the black box below, and press the enter key!

[setup]

rm -rf .git

[win]

# Initialize the time machine!
test -d .git

[congrats]

Nice! See that little owl squirrel that appeared? It will be your companion, and always show you where you are in time!
