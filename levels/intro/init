title = Enter the time machine
cards = init

[description]

You've been accepted to time travel school! Yay! It's your first day! Your teacher explains:

"To do anything with a time machine, you first need to initialize it! Go ahead, try it!"

[cli]
Instead of playing a card, you can slo type 'git init' directly into your terminal!

[setup]

rm -rf .git

[win]

# Initialize the time machine!
test -d .git

[congrats]

Nice! See that little owl squirrel that appeared? It will be your companion, and always show you where you are in time!
