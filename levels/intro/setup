One month later, you're woking on an essay about tardigrades!

This time, a friend has recommended that you use the version control system Git to keep backups of your file.

Currently, your directory only contains your essay. To initialize a Git repository in your directory, use the `init` card!

Then, each time you want to make a backup, use the `commit` card!

That way, you've made a backup of the current version of the file. 

[setup]

rm -rf .git

echo "~ Why tardigrades are cool ~

- They can survive in space.
- They are resistant to extreme heat and cold." > essay.txt

[win]

# Initialize a Git repository
test -d .git

# And make another commit
test -d .git && git rev-parse HEAD^

# Add at least two more lines.
test "$(git show HEAD:essay.txt | wc -l)" -ge 6
