So you've been working on a project for a while, and decide you want to put it in a Git repository.

Here's how to do it! First, you initialize a new Git repository in your current directory:

    git init

Then say that you want to record the current state of all files:

    git add .

And then you make a commit, which gives the current state a description, a date, and your name:

    git commit
