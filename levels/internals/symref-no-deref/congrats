Whew, we've covered a lot of things: Blobs! The index! Trees! Commits! Refs!

You now know about almost everything about how Git repositories look like on the inside! We think that's pretty cool! :)

Everything else is just convention and high-level commands that make interacting with the objects more convenient.

We haven't covered:

- tag objects (they are the fourth object type - a bit like refs with a description and an author)
- configuration (allows you to specify remote repositories, for example)
- working with local files (which is, uh, arguably pretty important :P)

Thanks for playing! You're welcome to check out the "puzzle" levels in the dropdown, some of them are more advanced!
