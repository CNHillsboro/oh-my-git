As soon as you have some tree objects, you can always read them and set the index exactly to their content! Unsurprisingly, the command is called

    git read-tree <tree>

For <tree>, you can provide the hash of any tree object - you can right-click one to insert its hash into the terminal!

Try reading some of the trees in this repository into the index!
