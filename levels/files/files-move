[description]

Our client just let us know they don't need sleep! Huh.

Because of that, they won't require a bed, and have asked you to build some other piece of furniture from the wood.

Can you rename the object into something else, give it a new description, and make a commit from that?

[setup]

echo A yellow cupboard with lots of drawers. > cupboard
echo A really big yellow shelf. > shelf
echo A comfortable, yellow bed with yellow cushions. > bed
git add .
git commit -m "Initial furniture"

[win]

NUM_FILES="$(git ls-tree --name-only -r HEAD | wc -l)"
NUM_BEDS="$(git ls-tree --name-only -r HEAD | grep '^bed$' | wc -l)"
test "$NUM_BEDS" = 0 && test "$NUM_FILES" -ge 3

[congrats]

Neat! It even still looks a bit comfortable!
