*ring ring* Oh no! You wanted to meet with your parents in your student apartment and your alarm did not go off in time to clean your room!

"Coming!" you yell while you jump out of bed. Now quick! 

[setup]

echo Very smelly socks. > socks
echo A tiny couch table. > table
echo An empty energy drink can. > can
echo An empty bag of chips. > bag_of_chips

[win]

# Remove all litter and trash.
! ls | grep bag_of_chips &&
! ls | grep can &&
! ls | grep socks

# But make sure to keep important things!
ls | grep table

[congrats]

Your parents are happy to see you (and, of course, your neat and tidy apartment)!
