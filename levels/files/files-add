Today has been stressful and exhausting. Let's make sure you know how to interact with your current environment, before doing fancy Git stuff.

You're moving into your student apartment, but soon discover that some furniture is missing!

[setup]

echo A yellow cupboard with lots of drawers. > cupboard
echo A small yellow shelf. > shelf

[win]

# Add two more pieces of furniture (in matching colors).
NUM_FILES="$(ls | wc -l)"
YELLOW_FILES="$(grep -l yellow * | wc -l)"
test "$NUM_FILES" -ge 4 && test "$YELLOW_FILES" = "$NUM_FILES"

[congrats]

Don't you immediately feel more at home?
